# Machine Learning Prediction of Drug Side effects in Clinical Trials

The code in the Matlab notebook contains an step-to-step example on how to run our algorithm, Geometric Self-Expressive Models (GSEM), on clinical trials data, and how to used it to predict in postmarketing side effect data, as shown in the paper.
